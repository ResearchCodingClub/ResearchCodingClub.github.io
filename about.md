# Introduction and target audience

Research Coding Club at the University of York is an informal group for people
who work with research software. We offer a modular training programme to
support researchers at any level in developing their software development skills
and applying the [FAIR (Findable Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)][fair]
principles and open research practices to their research software and data.

We welcome everyone working with research software, from undergraduates to
professors, from beginners to experts, and from people who create analysis
scripts on their laptops to those who run first principles modelling on
supercomputers.

Research Coding Club runs a training programme, where you can learn more about a
range of skills, and code clinics, where you can get help with your own research
software.

# Research Coding Course

Over the years we have developed extensive training materials and delivered
hands-on tutorials and seminars to hundreds of researchers on everything from
testing your code to how CPUs work. This year, we're building on the University
of Sheffield's excellent [FAIR²4RS][fair24rs] course to deliver a training
programme that will teach you a whole range of skills:

### Better software for better research: Introduction to the FAIR training programme

Wednesday 22nd October 2025, 2pm, online

In this introductory session we will try to understand what the FAIR principles
are and why they have emerged. We will then introduce some actions on how to
apply them to software and present a global review of the training programme.

### Software lifecycle planning

<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 5th</span> November 2025

When you start writing software it is often very useful to think about the
development process and how you will make your software sustainable in the long
term. In this module we will introduce important aspects of software development
in research: software lifecyle, management plan, licences and
dissemination. This module should allow you to ask yourself the right questions
when starting a research software project.

### Version control
The version control module has two distinct training sessions: one for beginners and one for more advanced users.

#### Introduction to Git and GitHub

<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 19th</span> November 2025, 2pm, hands-on
in-person<br>
Repeated <span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 21th</span> January 2026, 2pm, hands-on
in-person

If you’ve never heard of or used version control and Git before this is the
course for you. We start by introducing version control and exploring how it can
be beneficial to researchers, then we introduce some useful tools and get
started with some basic workflow using these tools. We build on those
foundations with collaborative exercises that introduce key concepts such as
forks, pull requests and branches and give you the chance to get some hands-on
experience with using version control in a research setting.

#### Git collaboration
This course aims to help you develop a deeper understanding of how Git works to
facilitate collaboration. It builds on the foundations laid by the Git beginners
course. The core idea around the course is that by improving your understanding
of working with branches and how to make your commits tidier and neater it makes
it easier to understand pull requests and Git history which in turn makes it
easier to collaborate and work on code with others (including your future
self!).


### Software design
<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 3rd</span> December 2024, in person.

The way you write your code will have a massive impact on how easy it is to
maintain. During this course we will learn how to create maintainable, readable
and reusable code. Using examples and exercises, we will see that creating high
quality code is actually quite straightforward when you understand how to do it
and what tools are available to make your life easier.

### Testing and Continuous Integration
<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 18th</span> February 2025, in person.

This course aims to equip researchers with the skills to write effective tests
and ensure the quality and reliability of their research software. No prior
testing experience is required! We’ll guide you through the fundamentals of
software testing using Python’s Pytest framework, a powerful and
beginner-friendly tool. You’ll also learn how to integrate automated testing
into your development workflow using continuous integration (CI). CI streamlines
your process by automatically running tests with every code change, catching
bugs early and saving you time.

### Documentation
<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 4th</span> March 2025, in person.

Well-documented software promotes reproducibility, maintainability, and
increased research impact through wider adoption and citation. This course
teaches researchers how to document their software effectively, making it
accessible and understandable to others. It covers topics such as writing
readable code and usage instructions.

### Reproducible computational environments
<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 18th</span> March 2025, in person.

Ensuring that others are able to take your code, run it, and are able to produce
the same (or equivalent) results is one of the key tenets of FAIR and
reproducible research software. This course will provide you with an overview of
different ways to make your code reproducible and then focus on virtual
environments as a specific tool for computational reproducibility.

### Packaging
<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 1st</span> April 2025, in person.

Packaging your software is one of the important steps in a software project to
make it both findable and accessible. This course will provide you with an
understanding of why and when packaging is useful, what different standards
exist to package Python and R projects and take you through each step of the
packaging process.

### Publishing a software paper in JOSS
<span style="color: #ff0000">Wednesday 16th</span> April 2025, hybrid.

Did you know that you can actually publish a paper about your software? This is
an ideal way to get recognition (and citation) for the software you have spent
countless hours creating. In this course we will walk you through an example of
submission in the Journal of Open Source Software. We will make an example
software submission to the journal, and thanks to the collaboration of the
Editor in Chief of JOSS (Arfon Smith), we will look at how the review process is
done.

## Prerequisites
Each session will have some individual prerequisites. Some experience with
developing research software or scripts, for example in Python or R, might be
needed. Please refer to the individual course details to know what they are.

## Learning outcomes
After completing this modular programme, participants should be able to:

- Understand the FAIR principles and describe how they apply to research software
- Explain how applying FAIR principles to research software can support open research goals such as transparency, reproducibility and reusability
- Identify actions that can be taken at different stages of the research lifecycle to enhance the FAIRness of their research software outputs
- Develop a plan addressing the intended scope, impact and lifespan of their research software
- Describe different types of software licence and discuss their potential implications for reuse of research software, including commercialisation
- Apply best practices for scientific software development including design, version control, testing, continuous integration and documentation
- Associate their research software with a unique and persistent identifier and use metadata to enhance its findability, accessibility and reusability
- Identify repositories that provide long-term persistent storage for research software
- Apply approaches such as packaging and containers to enhance the reusability and reproducibility of research software.

# Code Clinic

We also offer a service where you can discuss problems / ideas / anything around
the topic of research software. We have a bunch of experts in a wide variety of
technical subjects and research disciplines. We are currently refactoring how we
run this service, and will announce details shortly!
