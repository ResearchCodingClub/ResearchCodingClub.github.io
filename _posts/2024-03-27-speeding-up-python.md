In this talk, Liam Pattinson discussed why Python runs so slowly compared to other
languages, how to identify performance bottlenecks, and how to optimise our Python code.
The talk covered the use of profilers, how to get the most out of pure Python, how
NumPy works, and how to write NumPy that's both readable and efficient. It also briefly
covered going beyond NumPy, including the use of Numba, a just-in-time compiler, and
Cython, a compiled superset of Python.

The slides are available [here][slides].
