We all stand on the shoulders of giants, building on others' research,
and open source software such as NumPy, data.table, or LAPACK. How can
we effectively give back, and ensure that other researchers can
continue to build on our work?

In this Research Coding Club session, Ben Catt from the [Open Research
Team](https://www.york.ac.uk/library/info-for/researchers/support/)
spoke with us about how the Open Research Skills Framework can
benefit you, your research, and wider society. He'll took us through
the research lifecycle and the principles of research data management.
