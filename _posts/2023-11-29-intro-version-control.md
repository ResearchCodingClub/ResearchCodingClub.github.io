This week, we had our annual introduction to version control using Git
and GitHub. Version control is one of the foundational tools of
software development, whether you're writing small analysis scripts
for your own experiments, or large HPC simulations with lots of
collaborators.

This introduction covers the basics of working alone with git, making
commits, using branches, and pushing and pulling from GitHub.

The slides can be found [here][slides].
